            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p> I'm a full-stack data scientist who loves turtles <span>&#x1F422;</span> and solving unique problems.
                My hobbies outside of work include lifting weights, going on long walks, reading books,
                and working to build the local Tampa tech community. I am the program director at Tampa Devs, a local nonprofit that strives to provide high quality educational opportunities and networking events
                to any interested party. We cater to individuals at any point in their career, from bootcamp to senior manager. We have an active mentorship program and
                support job placement for candidates with local companies.
                Our motto is <b>"For free, and for everyone".</b>
